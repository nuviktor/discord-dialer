# Discord dialer

Minimal Discord dialer that connects to Discord and relays back commands to the phone (a web page with SIP.js). Requires a WebRTC-compatible SIP server. May serve as inspiration for your own.

Once you've navigated to the client web page you'll need to link it up with Discord through audio routing as you would with a normal dialer.

Tested with latest Firefox (55) and Asterisk (14.6).
